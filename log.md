# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Carousel and Horizontal RecyclerView to MoviesJa Android app

**Thoughts:** Thought about implementing my own carousel in Android but realized there are some really good libraries out there. Wanted to be able to properly visualize the layout in XML instead waiting to see at runtime if everything is ok so spent some time digging around online on the different XML tags needed for Android Studio to render it. Also saved myself a few lines of code as well.

**Today's Progress**: Got Cron Job up on Amazon EC2 Instance

**Thoughts:** Cron Jobs are pretty cool, heard about them but never really set one up before today.
